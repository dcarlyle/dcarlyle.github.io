# About

I enjoy technology, learning about it and helping others to understand how it can be used or repurposed for their needs. I have worked on a number of international machine learning projects in the area of digital signal processing to analyse accents within spoken languages.

I am an active member in STEM with a focus on LGBTQI+ and women in technology. I enjoy helping young people to find passion and excitment in technology, to help them open and expand their horizons in and out of work. As an experienced presenter, facilitator, negotiator and mentor, I am adept at risk, client and stakeholder management with excellent oral and interpersonal communication skills.

I am a resourceful and seasoned leader with twenty years of experience in IT software and consultancy. I founded a successful IT solutions and consultancy business, based in the UK and Asia, and ran it successfully for a decade servicing and satisfying a high-value client portfolio. During my tenure, I increased the value of revenue streams six-fold through new sales channels and partnership alliances. I also spearheaded numerous projects to streamline processes that reduced operating costs by 50%.

I am accomplished in building and motivating global, cross-cultural Agile teams, and have successfully delivered software applications and cloud solutions on schedule and budget. As a forward-thinking high achiever and experienced strategist, I am driven to ensure revenue growth and cost efficiency through innovative technological solutions and modern management techniques. I have consistently helped clients significantly reduce operational costs through creative solutions for process automation and optimisation. As a thought leader, I inspire and galvanise colleagues with innovative concepts. I've enjoyed taking teams from idea to achievement, demonstrating how to realise and replicate success in fields such as automation, Big Data, blockchain and machine learning (ML).

I am passionate about disruptive technologies like autonomous vehicles and natural language processing (NLP), and am currently researching machine learning for driverless cars. I’m a member of Mensa and the Australian Computer Society who enjoys keeping abreast of new developments in technology and genetics. As a keen cyclist, I’ve successfully completed RideLondon-Surrey 100 twice in recent years and regularly cycle in Spain and France. 

I'm a games enthusiast who enjoys playing creative interactive board games with friends.
