# What comes after public key encryption

When we go online, make a payment or go to a protect website, we trust in the encryption working behind the scenes to protect us.

There are two commonly used froms of encryption, RSA asymetric Public and Private Key and the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The RSA cryptosystem use large prime numbers and ECC is based on discrete logarithms on an eliptic curve..

Both of these encryption technics are resistant to brute force attack, where an attacker would try every possible combination of keys, it is just not feasibly worth while to attempt this due to the numerous combinations. 

However with the quantum algorithms, such as Shor's, it could be possible in principle to break these two trusted encryption techniques.

A number of companies are now starting to provide the frameworks to emulate and prepare for quantum computing, such as [Microsofts Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit).

Quantum computers are still in development, but the accuracy of them is improving and getting ever closer to their realisation. Quantum computation requires certain resources, such as the number of qubits used and the number of quantum gates.

A cryptologically useful quantum computer would be a machine exponentially faster than classical computers, that could break nearly every kind of encryption used to protect banking, medical, business and government records around the world.
